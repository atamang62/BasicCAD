## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)  I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

## Mount

### Description
Is a 120mm x120mm rectangle, centered on the origin.
Has 4 symmetric holes in the corners, 10mm in diameter, 20mm from each side (and therefore, 80mm from each other)
Has another 25 mm circle in the center of the square.
Extruded the same thickness as the base, 8mm

### Reflection
Making the mount was pretty easy. You can use the extrude button to either remove a shape or add a shape to the existng shape. I learned how to mirror by clicking the shape you want to mirror and clicking the axis you want to mirror over.

## Fork

### Description
The assignemnt had a circle with 80m in diamater and it was 8mm thick. I had to make a rectangle and exturde it. After that i had to round up the edges and mirror it on a plane

### Evidence

### Reflection
Using the mirror buttom made it so easier to make the fork. Insted of making another long piece, I can just mirror the piece over the desiered axis.

## Tire

### Description
In this I had to create a trapaziod and revolve it. After that you had to smooth out the edges of the trapaziod.

### Reflection
I learned how to revolve a shape. It is very important you click the right axis you want to revolve the shape or it will not work. You can use the fillet (shift-f) to round up the tire.

## Wheel and Barring

### Description
In this we had to create a t shape for the wheel. Revolve the whole thing and remove some shapes in the inside of the wheel. After that we had to fillet most of the thing.

### Image

### Reflection
I learned you can fillet everything by clicking the shape you want to fillet. You can use the circular pattern to duplicate the extruded shape into a circular pattern. You can also add many as you would like.

## AxleCollarBearings

### Description
We had to create the AxleCollarBearing it. You had to add a new part to the wheel. For the axle and the collar you had to create a long tube with a sepreate pice that sits on the tube.

### Reflection
Creating the three parts was pretty easy due to the [video.](https://youtu.be/2r7YqGuF1vY) I learned that you can add another part in the document by hitting the plus button in the bottom left. You can also add seprate pieces by sketching and extruding it as a new part.

## Wheel and Tire

### Description
In this we had assemble the parts wheel and tire together. Assembling the parts was pretty easy due to [this video on canvas.](https://youtu.be/R4PDBd8H5h8)

### Evidence

### Reflection
You can switch from part and assembly. You can insert the parts from other documents and create versions of them. I learend how to use the fastend mate (m) and revolve mate (m).


## Final assembly 

### Description
In this I had to put all the pieces together. To do that I had to switch over the the assembly part. After that, I dropped down all the parts and put them together using the mates.

### Evidence

### Reflection
In this I had to assemble all the parts together. Instead of dragging the piece and fastening it to the orgin, you can click the check and it automatically puts it in the orgin. You can add nuts and bolts by clicking the insert, then the standerd content.
