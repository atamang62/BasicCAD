## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)  I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

## Mount

### Description
Is a 120mm x120mm rectangle, centered on the origin.
Has 4 symmetric holes in the corners, 10mm in diameter, 20mm from each side (and therefore, 80mm from each other)
Has another 25 mm circle in the center of the square.
Extruded the same thickness as the base, 8mm

### Reflection
It was pretty easy because the video helped alot and the tools on onshape was easier to use.

## Fork

### Description
The assignemnt had a circle with 80m in diamater and it was 8mm thick. I had to make a rectangle and exturde it. After that i had to round up the edges and mirror it on a plane

### Reflection
Making the for was pretty easy. I learned if you can duplicate an object by using the mirror button.

## Tire

### Description
In this I had to create a trapaziod and revolve it. After that you had to smooth out the edges of the trapaziod.

### Reflection
This was also pretty easy to complete. I learned how to revolve a shape.

## Wheel

### Description
In this we had to create a t shape for the wheel. Revolve the whole thing and remove some shapes in the inside of the wheel. After that we had to fillet most of the thing.

### Reflection
Making the wheel took some time but it was easy to follow the insructions. I learned you can fillet everything by clicking the shape you want to fillet.

## AxleCollarBearings

### Description
We had to create the AxleCollarBearing it. You had to add a new part to the wheel. For the axle and the collar you had to create a long tube with a sepreate pice that sits on the tube.

### Reflection
Creating the three parts was pretty easy due to the video. I learned that you can add another part in the document by hitting the plus button in the bottom left. You can also add seprate pieces by sketching and extruding it as a new part.
